# Project Overview!

This web application is designed to run **SQL queries** in the browser. It provides an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily set up, modify, and run SQL queries on a database. The application provides a range of functionalities such as **filtering** and **sorting**, creating and managing views. It also includes a **query builder** that allows users to quickly create complex SQL queries. With its powerful features, users can efficiently manage their database with minimal effort.

# Javascript Framework

**Framework of choice**: _VueJS_
